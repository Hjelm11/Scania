# Coding for Scania

This is just a small assignment for you to do so that we have some code to discuss around during your interview at Scania.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a Service that returns data of Trucks (You dont need to setup a database you can stub the data)
3. Call this service with AngularJS and present the returned data in a web browser
4. Add a search function that can return data for a specific Truck
5. The data should be presented in the web browser

The solution should be built using C#, AngularJS (Angular 1 to be clear) and should also contain unit tests.
